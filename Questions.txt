parallell or sequential (round robin)
between sending and receiving

2 same program wont work
as when 1 sending other listening

if both send and same time and other not ready
(both stored in buffer)

Don't both sides need to by synchronized
(when 1 sending the other recieving?)
(blast off and stored untill recvfrom used on recievers end?)
(possiblty of 2 seperate programs paralleel sedn and recv)

Need format for screenshot to send + recv
